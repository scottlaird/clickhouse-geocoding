# Clickhouse Geocoding

This is a collection of SQL for implementing
[geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation) in
[Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/).  It's effectively a
version-controlled (and probably extended) copy of the code from my
blog post [Geocoding IP Addresses with
Clickhouse](https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/03/21/geocoding-ip-addresses-with-clickhouse/)
